# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for successful plays.
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose 
Louise's play Fever came close to it's fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Louise would like a better understanding of how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals in order to refine her next campaign to successfully reach it's full fundraising goal. The purpose of this analysis on the KickStarter dataset will be to identify trends in the data in order for Louise to better understand what elements make a campaign successful in regards to time of year it's launched and what campaign goal ranges have the highest success rates.

## Analysis and Challenges 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The largest number of theater projects are launched in May along with the highest number of successful outcomes. Projects with a launch date in the summer months of May - August have the highest number of successful outcomes with a steady decrease from May to September. 
2. The months of November and December have the lowest successful theater projects with December being roughly 50/50 on sucessful/failed.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Plays with a goal of "Less than 1000" and "1000 to 4999" have the highest percentage of success. Once a goal surpasses 15,000 then there's a higher degree of failing. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
For this challenge, we looked at the whole set of data rather than limiting it to the US. Filter for just US for the Outcomes Based on Goals, you'll see a slightly higher percentage successful and lower percentage failed in the 10000 to 4999 range than the whole set of data. 

It would be helpful to break down the Kickstarters by regions, particularly in the US. It would help to see if Kickerstarters in urban areas had a higher degree of success verses less urban areas.  

Other data elements that would help wtih the analysis would be how the project was spotlighted and what channels were used to advertise the Kickstarters. In addition, a dataset with the names and demographics of the backers would allow a deeper dive into who is donating, are they repeat donors, their average donations and what Kickstarters they tend to donate to. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other possible tables could be looking at outcomes based on the number of days the project was open. Did KickStarters that were open longer overall generate more funding? In addition, analyzing the affect that spotlighting could have on a successful outcome. There are some larger goal projects in the 35000 to 44999 range that standout as successful. It appears the difference in their success versus those that failed in the same goal range could depend on whether they were spotlighted or not. The spotlighted projects had considerably more backers. Also, an better understanding into the reason behind a KickStarter being spotlighted or not would useful.
